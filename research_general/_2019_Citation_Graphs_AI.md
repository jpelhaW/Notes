### Major Contributions
- we use the Microsoft Academic Graph to study the bibliometric evolution of AI research and its related fields from 1950 to today (2018)
	- Although early AI researchers exhibited strong referencing behaviour towards philosophy, geography and art, modern AI research references mathematics and computer science most strongly. Conversely, other fields, including the social sciences, do not reference AI research in proportion to its growing paper production

### Notes (Try to use backlinks)
- As AI becomes increasingly widespread, researchers and policymakers must balance the positive and negative implications of AI adoption. Therefore, we ask: how tightly connected are the social sciences and cutting-edge machine intelligence research
- early AI research was inspired by the several other fields, including some social sciences, modern AI research is increasingly focused on engineering applications
- odayâ€™s intelligent machines provide their own interesting social questions. For example, how responsible are the creators, the manufacturers and the users for the outcomes of an AI system? How should regulators handle distributed agency11,31? How will AI technologies reduce instances of human bias?
- To investigate, we study the association between various academic fields and AI research through the referencing relationship of papers published in each academic field.
- Before 1980, AI research made relatively frequent reference to psychology in addition to CS and mathematics
	- early AI research was shaped by a diverse set of fields. However, AI research transitioned to strongly relying on mathematics and CS soon after 1987, which suggests an increasing focus on computational research.
- How important is AI research to other academic fields? Unsurprisingly, CS, which includes all of the AI-related subfields in our analysis, steadily increased its share of references made to AI papers throughout the entire period of analysis
- when we control for AI paper production over time, we observe decreasing reference strength towards AI from all external academic fields.
- although scientific research is often undertaken at universities, major AI advances have emerged from industry research centres as well.
- Since 1980, the diversity of AI paper production, authorship and citations to AI papers across institutions have decreased by 30% according to the Gini coefficient applied to annual distributions
- Industry is increasingly central to AI research, but industry-authored AI papers are referenced less often by other academic fields.
- very few academic journals maintain high citation PageRank with the exception of the IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, which remains one of the most central publication venues for AI research.
- While universities dominate scientific progress across all academic fields43, industry-based organizations, including Google and Microsoft, are increasingly central to modern AI research, and the PageRank scores of academic institutions are on the decline.
- Although CS is becoming more diverse on the whole40, the scientific impact of AI research institutions is becoming less diverse (Fig. 3a)
