### Major Contributions
- In this work, we combine the two approaches of sentence scoring and lexical chain computing to generate summaries by using genetic algorithms. In addition to shallow, syntactic text features, we use lexical chains as a feature to score sentences in a deeper and semantic manner. 
- One novelty of this study is incorporating the lexical chain concept into a sentence scoring system as a new type of feature in GA

### Notes (Try to use backlinks)
- During training, for each training document, first the feature scores are computed for the sentences in the document. At each iteration of the genetic algorithm, feature weights are initialized randomly. Then the sentence scores are  calculated  and a summary is generated and evaluated for each document. The process repeats and the average of the precisions (Eqn. 15) gives the performance of that iteration. The best of all the iterations is selected by the genetic algorithm.
