### Major Contributions
- Preregistration - what you are going to do, and what you expect to find in your study
	- Ensure that all hypotheses and research methods are made ex plicit
before researchers are confronted with the data

### Secondary Contribution

### Limitations/Future Work
- Preregistration may not be possible for all kinds of studies. As discussed above, it has mainly been developed for quantitative studies (particularly experiments), and there are proposals for the preregistration of qualitative research (Haven and Grootel, 2019), eeeeeeeeeeeeeeealthough we have yet to see whether this idea will catch on.

### Notes (Try to use backlinks)
- Recent years have seen growing concerns about the reproducibility of scientific research, leading some to speak of a ‘reproducibility crisis’
	- This is also happening in NLP research
- This paper seems to be in the same direction as [[_2020_DatasheetsDatasets]]  and[[_2019_ModelCards]]
- preregistration allows us to distinguish between exploratory and confirmatory research
- Preregistration
	- Enter the hypotheses, design,and analysis plan of your study on a website
like the Open Science Framework, AsPredicted, or ResearchBox. These sites provide a time stamp; evidence that you indeed made all the relevant de cisions before carrying out the study.
