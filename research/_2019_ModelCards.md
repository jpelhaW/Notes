### Major Contributions
- model cards as a step towards the responsible democratization of machine learning and related artificial intelligence technology, increasing transparency into how well artificial intelligence technology works
	- The tentative to make a standard report card is valid and important. Most likely it won't bea complete list, but it sure make a good Appendix material.

### Notes (Try to use backlinks)
- There are no standardized documentation procedures to communicate the performance characteristics of trained machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models
