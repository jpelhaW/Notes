### Techniques
- [[theory]]

---
### Goal
Bring together the different aspects of meaning in NLP systems.

---
### Major Contributions
Bridge between theoretical cognitive semantics and psycholingustics.

---
### Secondary Contributions

---
### Limitations/Future Work
Quite throretical paper. It brings some concerns about aspects in language that should be incorporated, such as #perspective, #prominence, #resolution, #configuration, #metaphor but currently are not.

### Notes
"the way something is expressed reflects different ways of conceptualizing or construing the information being conveyed. We first define this phenomenon more precisely, drawing on considerable prior work in theoretical cognitive semantics and psycholinguistics." (Trott et al 2020:1)

"I work at Microsoft. I work for Microsoft" (Trott et al 2020:1)

"Such distinctions illustrate the general phenomenon of construal, which we claim has been neglected in NLP." (Trott et al 2020:1)

"recog-" (Trott et al 2020:1)

"nition of construal would provide a unified framework for addressing a wide range of issues involving meaning and linguistic variation, opening the way to systems that more closely approximate (actually) natural language." (Trott et al 2020:2)

"Fillmore's (1977) slogan, ME ANS CE NE S I NGS ARE REL ATI VI ZE D TO" (Trott et al 2020:2)

"As Langacker (1993, p. 460) observes, "any given situation can be viewed in multiple if not infinitely many ways." (Trott et al 2020:2)

"This view of linguistic meaning—which we might call inherently multivalent—is more flexible than in many theoretical and computational treatments, particularly truth-conditional approaches that liken meanings to facts in a database" (Trott et al 2020:2)

"We thus extend Fillmore's slogan to include all kinds of conceptual content (beyond scenes);" (Trott et al 2020:2)

"Contextual factors (e.g., the interlocutors' identity, beliefs, goals, conceptual repertoire, cultural backgrounds) can radically alter construed meaning" (Trott et al 2020:2)

"Construal. We define construal as a dynamic process of meaning construction, in which speakers and hearers encode and decode, respectively, some intended meaning in a given communicative context." (Trott et al 2020:2)

"Verbal and constructional alternations also manipulate prominence: The active/passive pair "Microsoft employs me" and "I am employed by Microsoft" differ in profiling the employer and" (Trott et al 2020:3)

"speaker, respectively. Similarly, transitive "I rolled the ball" vs. intransitive "The ball rolled" differ in whether the ball-roller is even mentioned." (Trott et al 2020:4)

"Greene and Resnik (2009) show that syntactic framing—e.g. active (Prisoner murders guard) vs. passive (Guard is murdered)—is relevant to detecting speaker sentiment about violent events." (Trott et al 2020:4)

"Aspectual composition." (Trott et al 2020:6)

"Verbs are associated with default aspectual classes that can be coerced under pressure from conflicting cues, where details of event structure systematically constrain possible coercions and their inferential consequences (Moens and Steedman, 1988; Talmy, 1988)." (Trott et al 2020:6)

"Even simple tasks like rescheduling a meeting pose many challenges to dialogue systems, in both understanding users' intents and formulating natural responses." (Trott et al 2020:7)

"5.3 Case study 3: Paraphrase generation Despite many advances, paraphrase generation systems remain far from human performance. One vexing issue is the lack of evaluation metrics that correlate with human judgments for tasks like paraphrase, image captioning, and textual entailment (see, e.g., Bhagat and Hovy, 2013; Pavlick and Kwiatkowski, 2019; Wang et al., 2019b). In particular, it is unclear how closely a good paraphrase should hew to all aspects of the source sentence." (Trott et al 2020:8)

"For example, should active/passive descriptions of the same scene, or the sets of sentences in (2), be considered meaning-equivalent?" (Trott et al 2020:8)

"Construal dimensions can provide a rubric for assessing tasks, datasets, and meaning representations (Abend and Rappoport, 2017) for which meaningful distinctions they make or require. (E.g.: Does it capture the level of RES Oat which entities and events are described? LUT I ON Does it represent ME TAP HOR? Is it sensitive to the of different event participants?) P ROMI NENCE" (Trott et al 2020:9)

"Popular NLU benchmarks (like SuperGLUE; Wang et al., 2019a) should be critically examined for potential construal biases, and contrasts should be introduced deliberately to probe whether systems are modeling lexical choices, grammatical choices, and meaning in the desired way (Naik et al., 2018; Kaushik et al., 2020; McCoy et al., 2019; Gardner et al., 2020)." (Trott et al 2020:9)

"As the saying goes, the camera doesn't lie—but it may tell us only a version of the truth. The same goes for language." (Trott et al 2020:9)
