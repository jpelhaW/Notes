### Major Contributions
- we propose that every dataset be accompanied with a datasheet that documents its motivation, composition, collection process, recommended uses, and so on.

### Secondary Contribution
---
### Limitations/Future Work
- The idea is great but it seems to suffer from the same problem as [[_2019_ModelCards]]
- Can these card be published/index/cited by themselves?
- Is there any support from scientific venues to publish this kind of material, or allow it to be added as an appendix?

### Notes (Try to use backlinks)
- machine learning community currently has no standardized process for documenting datasets, which can lead to severe consequences in high-stakes domains
- recent examples showing that machine learning models can reproduce or amplify unwanted societal biases reflected in training data
- data provenance is rarely discussed in the machine learning community
- without access to a dataset, researchers and practitioners can use the information in a datasheet to reconstruct the dataset.
- key stages of the dataset lifecycle: motivation, composition, collection process, preprocessing/cleaning/labeling, uses, distribution, and maintenance
- Academic researchers have adopted our proposal and released datasets with accompanying datasheets [e.g., 7, 10, 21]. Microsoft, Google, and IBM have begun to pilot datasheets for datasets internally within product teams.
