### Major Contributions
- Dataset annotation system/guidelines to keep track of NLP-ML advances.
- identify senteces in scholarly articles that reflect research contributions
- create structured  (subject, predicate, object) annotations from these sentences by identifying mentions of the contribution candidate term phrases and their relations
- group collection of such triplets, that arise from either conesecutive or non-consecutive sentences, under one of eight core information units that caputre an aspect of the contribution of NLP-ML articles

### Secondary Contribution

### Limitations/Future Work
- As most of the onthologies-based systems, it need collaboration data-feed-wise
---
### Notes (Try to use backlinks)
- Quite complicated guidelines to be followed in their annotation scheme
