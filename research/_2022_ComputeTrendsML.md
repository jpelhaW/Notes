### Major Contributions
- We curate a dataset of 123 milestone Machine Learning systems, annotated with the compute it took to train them.
- We frame the trends in compute in terms of three distinct eras: the Pre Deep Learning Era, the Deep Learning Era and the Large-Scale Era.  We offer estimates of the doubling times during each of these eras
- We extensively check our results in a series of appendices, discussing alternate interpretations of the data, and differences with previous work.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/ML-Progress/Compute-Trends)
- Our dataset contains three times more ML models than previous ones and includes data up to 2022. We also offer novel interpretations of previous data, which we believe have important implications for understanding progress in ML.

### Limitations/Future Work
- This dataset is biased in a number of important ways, and it is likely to contain mistakes. Beware of jumping to strong conclusions from our data. We discuss the limitations of our investigation in Appendix H.
- Our dataset only annotates the compute used for the fina training run.

### Notes (Try to use backlinks)
- Compute, data, and algorithmic advances are the three fundamental factors that guide the progress of modern Machine Learning (ML).
- Therefore, compute can be seen as a quantifiable proxy for the progress of ML research.
- ML training compute has followed a 3.4 month doubling time between 2012 and 2018.
- pre-2012 era. They found a doubling rate in training compute of about 2 years between 1959 and 2012.
