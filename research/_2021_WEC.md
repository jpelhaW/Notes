### Major Contributions
- we present Wikipedia Event Coreference (WEC), an efficient methodology for gathering a large scale dataset for cross-document event coreference from Wikipedia, where coreference links are not restricted within predefined topics. We apply this methodology to the English Wikipedia and extract our large-scale WEC Eng dataset.

### Notes (Try to use backlinks)
- In addition to setting baseline results for WEC-Eng, we assess our modelâ€™s competitiveness by presenting a new state-of-the-art on the commonly used ECB+ dataset. Finally, we propose that our automatic extraction and manual validation methods may be applied to generate additional annotated datasets, particularly for other languages.
- The choice to focus on event coreference was motivated by two observations:
	- (1) coreference resolution for Wikipedia anchor texts would be more challenging for event mentions than for entity mentions, since the former exhibits much higher degrees of both ambiguity and lexical diversity
	- (2) event structures, with their arguments (such as participants, location and time) available in the surrounding context, would facilitate a more natural dataset for the corpus-wide CD coreference task, compared to Wikipedia entity mentions which are comprised mostly of named entities.
