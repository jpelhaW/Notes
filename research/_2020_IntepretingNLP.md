### Major Contributions
- Tutorial  on methods for explaining the predictions of NLP models
	- Use AllenNLP Interpret
- Understanding what parts of an input led to a prediction: saliency maps, input pertubations
- how global decision rules led to a prediction
- Which Training Examples Caused a Prediction
- Devise simple rules based on input instead of features
- What happend when we change/disturb the input or even remove some tokens? -> they evaluate the result in the output/predictions
	- Some distubances are quite hard to follow, but others show problems/limitation on datasets
	- The remove-dataset element shows how much a specific element affect the entire prediction
