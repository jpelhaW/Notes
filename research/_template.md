### Major Contributions
- We present a taxonomy for characterising and understanding generalisation research in NLP, we use that taxonomy to present a comprehensive map of published generalisation studies, and we make recommendations for which areas might deserve attention in the future.
- five axes along which studies can differ: 
	- their main motivation, 
	- the type of generalisation they aim to solve, 
	- the type of data shift they consider,
	- the source by which this data shift is obtained, 
	- the locus of the shift within the modelling pipeline.

### Notes (Try to use backlinks)
- Systematic generalisation testing is not the status quo in the field of NLP.
- We design a taxonomy to characterise generalisation research, grounded in hundreds of existing generalisation studies; 
- We present an in-depth analysis based on over 400 papers with generalisation experiments that have come out in the last decades; 
- We make recommendations for which areas we believe deserve attention in the near future and; 
- We release a set of online tools that can help readers to better understand the current landscape of generalisation-testing, exploring the data by themselves
