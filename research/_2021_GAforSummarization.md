### Major Contributions
- This paper investigates the strengths of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for extractive sum
marization, as we hypothesized that GAs could construct more efficient solutions for the summarization task due to their relative customizability relative to deep learning models.

### Secondary Contribution
---
### Limitations/Future Work
- very naive work, lacks of too many details, but makes one wonder about brining GA into NLP.

### Notes (Try to use backlinks)
- text summarization can split broadly into two categories: abstractive and extrac tive. Abstractive summariziation involves producing a summary of central ideas through language understanding. Extractive summarization deals with identifying and isolating the most relevant or important parts of the text
- [Liu 2006] et al., was the first (to our knowledge) to directly apply GAs to text summarization. They utilized both word-level and sentence-level statistics to guide summarization, achieving near state-of-the-art results on the DUC2004 dataset.
