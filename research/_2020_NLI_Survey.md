### Notes (Try to use backlinks)
- the knowledge we have about the world and the underlying reasoning process, often called commonsense thought (Minsky, 2000) or commonsense reasoning (Davis & Marcus, 2015), that allows us to connect pieces of knowledge to reach the new conclusion.
- we attempt to provide an overview of three types of knowledge resources: linguistic knowledge, common knowledge, and commonsense knowledge.
	- Two particularly important domains of commonsense knowledge are intuitive physics, i.e., humans’ basic understanding of physical interactions in the world, and intuitive psychology, i.e., humans’ basic understanding of human emotion, behavior, and motives (DARPA, 2018).
- Section 3.1. lists several knowledge resouces
- Section 4.4. shows approaches for incorporating knowledge (neural)
