### Questions to be answered at the start of a new project:

1. Title of the project? Example: Citation-based Plagiarism Detection
2. What is the research question? How can currently not machine-detectable Plagiarism forms be automatically identified?
3. What is the addressed problem? Heavily disguised plagiarism, such as paraphrases etc., can currently not be automatically detected.
4. Are you familiar with the state-of-the-art? Yes, I'm familiar with x, y, z.
5. What are the disadvantages of the state-of-the-art you want to address or solve? The existing approach does not scale for larger collections and has bad precision and recall.
6. How do you plan to solve them? Considering not only string-matching algorithms but also other language independent markers such as similarities/patterns in citations, named entities, formulas etc.
7. How can the new approach be evaluated against the state-of-the-art? Yes, PAN test corpus and comparing it against other approaches/algorithms.
8. Is the contribution significant enough to be published? An answer like: "No one did it so far" may not be sufficient. ...

### Questions to Ask

- What is the (vision, key idea, goal) of the Ph.D. work?
- What is the underlying research problem that you intend to solve?
- Why is your solution novel, how is it different from related work/the state of the art?
- How can one derive the research gap from the literature?
- What are your ideas for solving the research problem?
- What research methodology will you use in order to solve the problem?
- How will you evaluate your solution? What metric will you use to compare yourself to the state of the art, and how/when will you declare success? What improvement do you expect according to your metric?
- What is the scope of your thesis? Which aspects do you exclude?
- What is the expected scientific contribution?

#### If applicable

- What progress have you made since your previous Ph.D. status presentation? Which impact with regard to papers, prototypes, demos, etc. did your work have? What challenges have you encountered? Have you had to change your previous plans? Why and how?
- What are the next steps you will take? What papers do you plan for which venue during the upcoming year? Give key points of the abstract of planned papers with regard to goal, research problem, and expected solution.
