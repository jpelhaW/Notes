Naming conventions allow fast deduction and access to resources based on regularities. Furthermore we ensure that each name is unique to each scope and are properly linked within the knowledge graph.

#### Publications
- The naming convention for files is `_year_methodname` (e.g., for the BERT paper this would look like `_2018_BERT`).
- What if there is no simple `methodname` as BERT? Just keep it short and use established naming from the related literature.

####  Backlinks
- Backlinks to topics in general should not start with a underscore `_`. Other than that keep the topics the same and avoid stuff like two links for the same topic, e.g., `BERT` and `bidirectional encoder representations from transformers`.

#### Figures
- Always start a figure name with `figure` and end the name with the name from the paper that you extracted it from or that it is related to. For example if you want to include a figure from the BERT paper, the name could look like `figure_model_2018_BERT`.

#### Tags
- Please keep the Zotero tags and Obsidian tags in sync and use the same for fast search. Tags should follow the convention `field_subfield_tag` to distinguish for different research areas that we are interested in. For example if you want to tag bidirectional language models you would use the tag `NLP_LM_bidirectional`. Try to keep the tags as short as possible. If you use shortcuts without established casing, always case them in `UPPERCASE`.
