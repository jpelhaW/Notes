### Major Contributions
-  Probably the first work to use [[_2019_BERT]] into the human trafficking detection problem
-  Combide [[_2019_BERT]] , [[_2003_LDA]] and [[_2017_fastText]] into one single vector space to make their classification

### Secondary Contribution

### Limitations/Future Work
- 'We created a dataset of advertisement texts by crawling thousands of ads extracted from various adult websites in 2017.' - No information about the dataset itself
- The does not support many of its arguments
