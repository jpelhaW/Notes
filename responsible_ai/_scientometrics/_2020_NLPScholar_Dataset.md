### Major Contributions
- Our interests lie in the study of scholarly research in Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, Google Scholar does not provide information on the field of study pretraining to individual papers Thus, in this project, we combine information from Google Scholar with a dedicated high-quality source of information for NLP papers, the ACL Anthology (AA).
- we present the NLP Scholar Datasetâ€”a single unified source of information (from both AA and Google Scholar) for tens of thousands of NLP papers
- Note that while AA is freely available, the information about papers is spread across several files. Through NLP Scholar, we not only aggregate the AA information into a standard database, we also add to the metadata, for example, by determining whether a paper is long paper or a short paper, whether it is a workshop paper or a main conference paper, whether it is a demo paper, etc.
