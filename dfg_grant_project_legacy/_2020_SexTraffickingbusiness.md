### Major Contributions
---
- Standard natural language pre-processing techniques are then applied to the text reviews and converted into a bag-of-words model with Term frequency inverse document weighting. 
	- The resulting Document-Term matrix is used to train a classifier and then to identify suspicious activity from the remaining reviews.
	- Classifiers used: [[SVM]], [[NaiveBayes]], [[RandomForest]], [[NeuralNetworks]]
- They also use hand-mde features:
	- state, location, attributes, names, postal code, stars, categories, address, latitude, user-id,etc
