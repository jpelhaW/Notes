### Major Contributions
- Best results are obtained by using linear SVM on 1-gram features when removing stop words as well as by using multinomial Naive Bayes on 1-gram features when not removing stop words.

### Secondary Contribution
- Good related work:

### Limitations/Future Work
- Naive study and approaches, in which simple n-grams is used for BOW and TF-IDF feed into a SVM/NB classifier

### Notes (Try to use backlinks)
- They used the PAN2012 dataset
- Craven defined the grooming as “a process by which a person prepares a child, significant adults and the environment for the abuse of this child.”
- face the cyber-pedophilia problem with different goals,
	- including Identification of predatory chat lines;
	- Classification of predatory chat conversations;
	- Identification of the offender and the victim in a predatory conversation.
- it was shown that sexual predators might suffer from emotional and instability and psychological problems. So, considering the sentiment polarity analysis might give us some clues about the online predators
